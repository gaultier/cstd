- [x] aio fs linux: if only watching for file changes in a directory, we only need to watch the directory.
- [ ] aio fs linux: move pg_aio_fs_wait_one to pg_aio_fs_wait due to inotify deficiencies
- [ ] watchdir: only watch directories and cache the (hashed) state to avoid watching each file individually
      - dir: name, [CachedDirEntry] (+ hash?)
      - CacheDirEntry: mtime, name, size (+ content hash?)
- [ ] aio fs macos/bsd: impl pg_aio_fs_wait
- [ ] test runner with name filtering
- [ ] gracefully handle ENOMEM
- [ ] dwarf: iterator on DIE (easier than on DWARF forms)
